# 2023 FIRST Energize Robot Code

Team 5590's 2023 FRC robot code for the FIRST Energize robot. The code is written in Java and is based off of [WPILib's Java "Command-Based" control system](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/index.html).

The code is divided into several packages, each responsible for a different aspect of the robot function. This README document explains the function of each package, some of the variable naming conventions used, and setup instructions. Additional information about each specific class can be found in that class's `.java` file.

Note that terminal commands include the `$`, but should not be included int the command. They simply show that they are a terminal command and not programming code. Exclude the `$` when you run it.
